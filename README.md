# Hello-world
Just another repository :v

Hi, programmers!

I'm new to this plataform, but i've already used c++ and a bit of python, but i'm still a noob, and i don't know about the libraries used, how to used them (i usually call:"stdio.h", "strings.h" ","Maths".

i'd like to know your opinions on wich library i should learn to use, beggining with the "windows.h".
